# Stock-Market-API-K8s

In this project I created a rest API that runs on Kubernetes. This is repository consists of job.yaml which creates the pod, service.yaml file and a secrets.yaml file for passing in environment variables.

I also used GitLab as my CI/CD, to automatically push code changes to my EKS cluster.
An example of a successful pipeline run:

Here's the link to my GitLab repository that contains all of the same code, along with a couple of GitLab config files
